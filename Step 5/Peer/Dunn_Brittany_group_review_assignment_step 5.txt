Yes

Is there a better way that data could be displayed on these pages? OR Could the style of the webpage be improved?
I agree with Andrew about expanding some of the columns that have a lot of text and Hilary about the margin on the bottom. The pictures on the home page are a little oddly placed since they are centered and everything else is to the left.

No

DELETE functionalities

All appear to be working correctly.

For the Inkling inventory, either the buying of gear and weapons is not working or the display is not working. I think what is happening though is anything bought is being added to 1:Splat Tim and not the selected Inkling.

When shopping for gear and weapons, it would be helpful to list what gear they already have. Also the pages could be styled, but you may just be waiting till the last step to do this like I am.

Anything else that you think is important for READ functionalities?
            Nothing additional than previous comments.

DELETE functionalities

Delete does not work for gear or inkling.

As others have mentioned, I had issues with the page not working. Refresh does not fix it and I must use the link again.

No

DELETE functionalities

I was able to delete products, but I could not find where to delete an order. Since your delete implementation is narrow I would just double check you are meeting the requirements.

There is not a list of restaurants

No (as mentioned)

The shadow on text of the homepage made it difficult for me to read. Maybe add a page to add a restaurant without going through a current list.

Anything else that you think is important for READ functionalities?
Is there supposed to be a page which displays recommended restaurants? I am a bit confused what the recommend button will do when it works.

Not working (as mentioned)

Present but not working (as mentioned)

 All the relationship tables should display names instead of id using joins, but this looks like something you may be working on still.

Delete works only for teams and countries.
