	Yes. 
2.	What is the effect of this UPDATE on the relationships that the entity is participating in ?
Updating stock, twitter, or game does not affect company. Updating genre does not affect game. Updating genre effects game. 
3.	What is the effect of CREATE and DELETE operations on the other entities that are participating in the relationship with this entity?
Creating a company allows it to be added to a relationship with stock, twitter, and game. Creating a game allows it to be added to a relationship with genre. Deleting a stock, twitter, and game does not remove a company. Deleting a game does not remove a genre. Deleting a genre does appear to remove a game but does not actually remove it, see below. Deleting a company removes stock, twitter, and games. 
4.	Anything else that you think is important for the UPDATE functionality?
When a genre is deleted, it appears to delete all games with that genre because they no longer appear in Current Games on the game page. I do not think this is working correctly though because the game will still appear on the homepage and when you try to create a game with the same name and company but different genre as the “deleted” one you get this error message: 

{"code":"ER_DUP_ENTRY","errno":1062,"sqlMessage":"Duplicate entry 'test' for 
key 'game_name'","sqlState":"23000","index":0,"sql":"INSERT INTO game (game_name, release_date, rating, companyID) VALUES ('test', '', '', '6');"}
I am guessing you are setting genre to null for a game when that genre is deleted and your query for current games is using inner joins instead of a left join to make sure it picks up on games with null genres.

	Yes. 
2.	What is the effect of this UPDATE on the relationships that the entity is participating in ?
Updating username does not affect lists. 
3.	What is the effect of CREATE and DELETE operations on the other entities that are participating in the relationship with this entity?
Creating a user allows it to be added to a relationship with lists. Creating a restaurant allows it to be added to a relationship with a list and recommendation lists.  Deleting a restaurant from a list removes the relationship with list and does not delete the restaurant or the list. Deleting list removes relationship with user and does not delete the restaurant. 
4.	Anything else that you think is important for the UPDATE functionality?
I am not sure if this is your intention, but if a recommendation list has a restaurant in it, it will not delete. Also on the add new list page, recommendation is misspelled in “Make it a Recomendation List!”
